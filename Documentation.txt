                                                Video Game Collection

To use this application, be sure you clone it using:
 <git clone https://github.com/Noah-Hickey/NESGameCollectionTracker>

                                                Requirements

Once you have cloned this repository to an IDE such as IntelliJ or VS Code, ensure you have the Java JDK installed and
Maven installed. Once that is completed, run <mvn compile> in the terminal and run the program.

                                                    General

 This program is a command line interface Maven project coded in Java. This program is designed to store information
 of a video game collection. Particularly for me, I collect NES games so it is tailored around that but feel free to
 fork and edit to your liking.

 The Nintendo Entertainment System is one of my favourite gaming consoles, so I was glad to make an application
 to help my collecting efforts.

                                                    Usage

 Running the MainMenu program, you will see in your terminal options many options. The 5 you will see are:
 the story of me and my history with the NES, add a game to the collection, remove a game from the collection,
 randomly select a game from the collection, and exit to close out the program. There should be some game data
 in the program by default for testing purposes.

                                         Clean Code(Screenshots in repo)

    1. I added in variables to expand or add to the program I am able to do so. Added in SEPARATOR and
    SUB_SEPARATOR variables to avoid repeating myself and making the code neater. When implementing menus I can
    now do it much easier.

    2. I added in variables MIN_RATING, MAX_RATING, and nextId. MIN_RATING and MAX_RATING are added to make the code
    more readable and easier to understand. I also added in nextId because I know there are 5 games in the system
    and nextId is set to 6 and I can simply increment nextId if I need to increase the game count.

    3. I added in a method to display game catalog for both the remove and add sections of the menu to avoid repeating
    and reduce the length of my file.

                                                Test Cases

    1. testInitialGameCatalogSize - The first test asserts that there are 5 games in the catalog for testing purposes.

    2. testInitialGamesHaveValidIds() - The second test ensures that the list of games all contain proper IDs.

    3. testSuperMarioBros3() - Since I know Super Marios Bros. 3 is in the catalog, this test asserts the game is there
    with the correct title, genre, and year it was released.

                                               Dependencies

 The only dependency I used was J Unit for testing and I watched the class recording to get the proper dependency call.

                                                Problems

 I had several problems with this QAP. I had to re-install IntelliJ a few days ago so I had to make sure all my
 Maven and Java versions worked properly which took time. I also had an issue with testing my file because the file and
 folder structure was incorrect on several occasions. I finally managed to fix it by ensuring that the test directory
 mirrored my main project.
